  description: My work at MBRDI was mainly focused on Electric Vehicle Data Analysis for Electromagnetic Compatibility of the system.
               In addition to this, I developed a controlling mechanism for the Cooling Unit using Markov Decision Processes and 
               Reinforcement Learning to supply power according to the needed demand. Futhermore, I predicted the energy demand of a
               particular route using regression analysis and neural networks.
