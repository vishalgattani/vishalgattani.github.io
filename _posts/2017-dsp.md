## Nyquist Frequency

According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, to accurately reconstruct an analog signal from a series of digital samples, the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency component of the signal. The Nyquist frequency, therefore, is half of the sampling rate ($f_s$). To compute the highest frequency contained in a signal, you need to perform a spectral analysis of the signal using a Fourier transform.

## Linear Time Invariant systems

A system is LTI if it satisfies two properties: linearity and time-invariance.

- Linearity: A system is linear if it follows the principle of superposition, which means that the output of the system for a sum of inputs is equal to the sum of the outputs for each individual input. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

```css
y[n] = a * x[n] + b * x[n-1]   => linearity property
```
where `y[n]` is the output, `x[n]` and `x[n-1]` are the inputs, and a and b are constants.

- Time-invariance: A system is time-invariant if its response to an input signal does not change with time. This means that if the input signal is shifted in time, the output signal will also be shifted in time by the same amount. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

```css
y[n] = F(x[n])   => time-invariance property
```
where `F` is the system's response to the input signal.

## Causality

A signal is said to be causal if its output depends only on past and present inputs, and not on future inputs. In other words, the value of a causal signal at any given time depends only on the values of the signal at earlier times and the values of any inputs that have been applied up to that time.

Mathematically, a signal `x[n]` is causal if it satisfies the condition:
```css
x[n] = 0, for n < 0
```

## Z-Transform

The poles of the Z-transform are important because they provide information about:

1. Stability: If all the poles are inside the unit circle in the z-plane, the system is stable. If any of the poles are outside the unit circle, the system is unstable.
2. Frequency response: The position of the poles in the z-plane determines the location of the resonant frequencies and the shape of the frequency response of the system.

## Filters

1. Lowpass filter: A lowpass filter attenuates high-frequency components of a signal while passing low-frequency components. The cutoff frequency of a lowpass filter is the frequency above which the signal is attenuated.

2. Highpass filter: A highpass filter attenuates low-frequency components of a signal while passing high-frequency components. The cutoff frequency of a highpass filter is the frequency below which the signal is attenuated.

3. Bandpass filter: A bandpass filter attenuates frequencies outside of a specified frequency range while passing frequencies within the range. A bandpass filter has two cutoff frequencies, a lower cutoff frequency and an upper cutoff frequency, which define the range of frequencies passed by the filter.


4. Bandstop filter: A bandstop filter, also known as a notch filter, attenuates frequencies within a specified frequency range while passing frequencies outside of the range. A bandstop filter has two cutoff frequencies, a lower cutoff frequency and an upper cutoff frequency, which define the range of frequencies attenuated by the filter.
