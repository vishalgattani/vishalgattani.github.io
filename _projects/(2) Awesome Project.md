# Biomimetic Arm with Motion Capture v/s Inverse Kinematics

- Human upper limb motion captured through Kinect V2 will be transmitted to various actuators that act as joints on the prosthetic arm.
- The captured data, joint coordinates and angles, will be transmitted through a serial port to arduino and dynamixel shield in order to actuate the servos accordingly.
- The data from both, Motion Capture and Inverse Kinematics, will be synthesised and compared to establish if correlation points exist between the experiments.
- Possible control of the prosthetic may also be achieved through Electromyography (EMG).
