# Building A Structured Streaming Data Pipeline

Robot Operating System (ROS) is a framework for building robot applications that generates large amounts of data. As there are complexities involving in collecting and processing data, it is important to have a structured pipeline to process the data. In this post, we will discuss the structured data pipeline for ROS.

The pipeline is constructed using the following components:

1. Data Source: This component collects data from various sources such as sensors, cameras, and other devices. For the purposes of this post, we will assume that the data source is a ROS node.
2. Message Queue: This component is responsible for storing and processing the data. It is a queue-based system that allows for the processing of data in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner. For the purposes of this post, we will assume that the message queue is implemented Kakfa.
3. Data Processing Engine: This component processes the data and generates output. For the purposes of this post, we will assume that the data processing engine designed using Apache Spark.
4. Data Sink: This component stores the processed data in a database or a file system. For the purposes of this post, we will assume that the data sink is a Apache Cassandra database.
