# Unity Traffic System

I am learning Game Development and this is a Unity project that simulates traffic flow in a city. It uses the Unity physics engine to simulate the movement of vehicles and pedestrians. The simulation is based on the concept of waypoints, which are used to define the path of vehicles and pedestrians. The waypoints are arranged in a hierarchical structure, with each waypoint having a parent and child waypoints. This allows for the creation of complex traffic flow patterns, such as loops and forks.

The simulation also includes a waypoint manager tool, which allows for the creation and management of waypoints in the scene. This tool is useful for creating and editing the traffic flow patterns in the city.
