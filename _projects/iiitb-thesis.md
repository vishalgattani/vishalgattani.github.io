description: The motivation of this thesis is to implement control strategies on a Hybrid Prosthetic arm that combines the motion capture technology derived from the Kinect through implementing a marker-less motion capture system, which will complement the equipment from Trossen Robotics and the prosthetic design from Reachy. In doing so, two new control strategies are compared and performed: Motion Capture (MoCap) based control and Endpoint control through Inverse Kinematics using Blender software.
