# **About Me**

<!-- Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br> -->
Hi, I am Vishal! :wave:<br>

A robotics software engineer in practice, Vishal is interested in robotics, game development, process automation, and simulation modeling. His interests are multi-disciplinary where he may apply his existing skillset to new areas and use the opportunities to expand his knowledge and grow his skills. He thrives in new environments and rises to meet any challenge. 

He has always been fascinated by the intersection of software and hardware, focusing on bridging the gap between the real world and its digital twin. This interest was solidified during his first thesis, where he focused on teleoperating a 3D-printed robotic arm and its digital twin which deepened his passion for fusing software and hardware, leading him to pursue higher education at the University of Marylandâ€”College Park, where he majored in Systems Engineering.

As a Software Engineer at the [Simulation-Based System Design Laboratory](https://enme.umd.edu/research/simulation-based-system-design-laboratory) for [Institute for Systems Research](https://isr.umd.edu/), University of Maryland College Park, he leads the development of a full-stack application that accelerates software simulation testing, verification, and validation. He has implemented process and test automation tools and redesigned the simulation interface enabling researchers to bring their work to fruition faster through automated data acquisition pipelines, creating and validating synthetic simulation scenarios, and information retrieval mechanisms, reducing simulation setup time. Vishal enjoys working with people to manage projects and facilitate the organization of new, improved workflows.

Apart from being a full-time Chelsea fan, he creates digital art in Blender Game Engine and he is actively learning game development and animation system in Unity3D. His hobbies include character rigging, graphic design, and rendering animations.

Vishal graduated from the University of Maryland College Park with a [Master of Science in Systems Engineering](https://isr.umd.edu/education/msse-degree) degree. He defended his thesis dissertation titled "Experimental Design using Bayesian Belief Network for Simulation-based assurance cases" in May 2023 to determine the optimal experimental design for a simulation. Using Bayesian Networks, he implemented a Bayesian framework that helps understand which areas the experimentation should focus on to achieve successful confidence in the development of assurance cases.

Previously, he completed his Integrated Masters of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering at [International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/) where he was employed as a Research Associate at [Surgical and Assistive Robotics Lab](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/sarl/sarl.html) led by Prof. Madhav Rao.

His ultimate goal is to become a robotics engineer who specializes in the design and development of robotics systems and enables the transition of robots from simulation to the real world.
