Hi, I am Vishal! :wave:,<br>

Currently, I am pursuing Master of Science at University of Maryland College Park, majoring in Systems Engineering and specializing in Robotics. I am a Gradute Research Assistant working on Simulation-Based Verification for Autonomous Systems to develop and evaluate simulation-based methods for verifying the performance of autonomous vehicles in the presence of environmental uncertainties and adversarial actions. I completed my integrated Masters in Electronics and Communication Engineering at [International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/). My academic interests lie in the areas of Robotics and Control. Previously, I was employed as a Research Associate at [Surgical and Assistive Robotics Lab](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/sarl/sarl.html) led by Prof. Madhav Rao.
