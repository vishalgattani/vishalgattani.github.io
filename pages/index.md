# The latest scoop
At University of Maryland, College Park, I am:
* Transitioning from an automation engineer role to implementing DevOps practices for enhanced version control and regression testing.
* Implementing systems to execute simulations on randomized scenarios, improving test coverage and robustness.
* Currently, learning AWS to effectively set up pipelines that enhance deployment processes and support continuous integration and delivery.
* Enhancing the Unity simulator by creating a waypoint-based pedestrian system to model realistic pedestrian behaviors, improving the fidelity of urban environment simulations.
